# Change Gnome gdm login background

The only one that worked for me on Arch Linux:

    sudo -u gdm dbus-launch gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri 'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/picture.jpg'
Then, you can verify it worked:

    sudo -u gdm gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri

Or verify using dconf:

    sudo -u gdm dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/picture-uri
